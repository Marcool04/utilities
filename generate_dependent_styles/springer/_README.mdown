 * Received new list from Springer containing the journals and the used citation style.
 * Enrich this list with various other data sources: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJjCrjv42X5nWcPGYXnC7_Dtg96mwuw5EdVDDGleDi0/edit?usp=sharing
    * from the current journal price list from Springer we take the primary language (and can perform some data sanity tests)
	* from the current _journals.tab list we take the short title and field if present
	* a mapping from the words spring is using and the CSL styles as well as the locales is needed
	* with some formulas based on mainly on VLOOKUP functions we can take all these information from different data sources together (here it is important to check that the ranges are adjusted to new length of tables and that the ranges are not changing in different rows)
	* filter out the rows whith bibliography empty, AsInManuscript or citation style Alphanumeric, Nonstandard
 * Export relevant part as tab delimited text file (maybe save it first in Excel)
 * Check that file encoding is UTF-8 w/o BOM
 * start the script first time:
    `ruby -E UTF-8 generate_styles.rb -d springer`

Springer gave us a new list of its journals and the used citation style (obtained from a database query).
We enriched this list with some data and prepared that for updateing the Springer styles here in the CSL repo.
See
https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/pull/1526 and
https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/issues/1122

Add overwriting data to \_extra.tab for:

- Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry: https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/commit/2fd0897e82ec721dcb68e306cef509b347a1b1d4
- Basic Research in Cardiology: https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/pull/1075
- Plant Ecology: https://github.com/citation-style-language/utilities/issues/19

The list of styles for Springer journals was obtained from Springer / Mekentosj in an XLS format. After removing journals that have ceased publications, there remained 1421 journals. The list of journals was stored in `journals_raw.txt`.

Springer also provided a PDF file describing the various styles used by their journals, see file `Key_Style_Points_1.0.pdf`, as well as `manuscript-guidelines-1.0.pdf`. These documents are also available online:

- [http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/manuscript-guidelines-1.0.pdf]()
- [http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/Key_Style_Points_Aug2012.pdf]()

Using this information, the goal was to:

- generate parent styles corresponding to each of the styles described in the PDF, and listed for the different journals
- generate a final list of journals in the correct format `_journals.tab`, that would work with the template `_template.csl`, and that would have the final identifier for the `independent-parent` style, the correct value for `citation-format`, and a correct value for `field` attribute(s)

Here is more information on the styles we already have in the repository, as emailed by Sebastian:

> I had a quick look:
> The "Springer Basic" style from the Key Notes is our "Springer (Author Date)"
> The "Springer Vancouver" style is _not at all_ equivalent to our "Springer Vancouver" (cf. e.g. the date placement) - we'd have to check on that and see what we use the Springer Vancouver for. The style they call Vancouver is actually very similar to regular Vancouver.
> The Springer "MathPhys" style is close but not equivalent to the Springer LNCS style (and I checked, the LNCS style is correct)
> The Springer "Physics" styles is very close to the American Institute of Physics or American Physics society (we'd have to check e.g. formatting of numbers in text and bibliography, otherwise the two are identical)
> The Springer "SocPsyc" style is a simplified APA version - we probably need to code that
> The Springer "Humanities" style is a variant of Chicago (author date) - they say 15th edition, which might mean some significant divergence, we'd have to check.
>
> I don't have any insight on how the Springer "Plasmonics" and "Protocols" styles fit in.
>
> Hope that helps,
> Sebastian

A "Springer Humanities" style has been added by Sebastian Karcher to be used as the parent for some of the journals: https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/commit/e9ed9b22d0b999176220486c5ae21639e555420a

Here is also more notes on language locales for the "Humanities" styles, as gathered by Sebastian:

> Paläontologische Zeitschrift is published in English entirely
> Zeitschrift für Vergleichende Politikwissenschaft allows for English and
> German articles with respective locales, so either we leave the style
> locale free or we have both
> KZfSS Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie and
> Österreichische Zeitschrift für Soziologie are German entirely.

### Generation of `_journals.tab`

We have the list of journals in a "raw" format in `journals_raw.tab`. To generate the final `_journals.tab` file, we need to go through the Springer list and generate the proper CSL identifier to be used as the parent style, as well as the citation format. The other fields can be used as-is: title, issn, eissn, etc...

The final journal list is generated with the script `process_raw_springer_list.rb` which does the following:

- load the journal information from `journals_raw.tab` into an array of hashes
- for each journal info:
	- output unchanged fields title, issn, eissn, ...
	- "translate" the `Bibliography` + `Citation` values, which correspond to the Springer nomenclature, into the proper CSL identifiers that correspond to the style output in the author instructions, and into the proper value for the `citation-format` attribute

The translation dictionary looks like this:

	Bibliography   Citation   Springer id               CSL id
	------------   --------   -----------               ------
	APA            NameYear   SocPsych Author Name      springer-socpsych-author-date
	APA            Numbered   SocPsych Numbered         springer-socpsych-brackets
	APS            NameYear   Physics Author Name       springer-physics-author-date
	APS            Numbered   Physics Numbered          springer-physics-brackets
	Basic          NameYear   Basic Author Name         springer-basic-author-date
	Basic          Numbered   Basic Numbered            springer-basic-brackets
	Chicago        NameYear   Humanities Author Name    springer-humanities-author-date
	Chicago        Numbered   Humanities Numbered       springer-humanities-brackets
	MathPhysSci    NameYear   MathPhys Author Name      springer-mathphys-author-date
	MathPhysSci    Numbered   MathPhys Numbered         springer-mathphys-brackets
	Vancouver      NameYear   Vancouver Author Name     springer-vancouver-author-date
	Vancouver      Numbered   Vancouver Numbered        springer-vancouver-brackets

The `citation_format` attribute is 'author-date' for 'NameYear' and 'numeric' for 'Numbered'.

### TODO: take into account title adjustements


The Patient - Patient-Centered Outcomes Research	The Patient: Patient-Centered Outcomes Research


### TODO: Adjust parent styles

Still some work needed to adjust those parents, from the most divergent to the most accurate:

- springer-socpsyc ~ APA
- springer-mathphys ~ LNCS
- springer-vancouver = almost vancouver
- springer-physics = almost APS


### TODO: Clean-up

* Check the remaining dependent styles that now refer to an unused springer parent:

	- springer-author-date
	- springer-vancouver
	- springer-plasmonics
	- springer-protocols


* Check the remaining dependent styles that had to be skipped because they already existed with another parent, which we should change to the ones we have now added. These styles are listed in the `_skip.txt` file:

	- springer-author-date
	- springer-vancouver
	- springer-plasmonics
	- springer-protocols


* There is also the problem of numeric citations, which are not always square brackets, in contradiction with the Springer document. We need to determine which styles are:

	- square brackets
	- parentheses
	- superscript
	- others?

* Problems with locales in the dependent for the humanities styles, in particular German vs English, see https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/commit/e9ed9b22d0b999176220486c5ae21639e555420a

See https://github.com/citation-style-language/utilities/issues/11

Here is what I did:

- downloaded the spreadsheet from [http://cms.iopscience.iop.org/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/e2b2660a-25d8-11df-afda-57ea8c8155d6/IOPscience%20URLs%20by%20journal.xls?guest=true](http://cms.iopscience.iop.org/alfresco/d/d/workspace/SpacesStore/e2b2660a-25d8-11df-afda-57ea8c8155d6/IOPscience%20URLs%20by%20journal.xls?guest=true)
- added a column 'Citation' for the citation format
- added a column 'Parent', either "institute-of-physics-harvard.csl" or "institute-of-physics-numeric.csl"
- sorted based on 'Journal End' to be able to remove journals no longer published (any journal that has an end date)

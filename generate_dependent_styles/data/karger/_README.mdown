Compiled metadata mostly by hand.

Excluded the following journals for now since they use a different citation format:
Cytogenetic and Genome Research
Folia Primatologica
Molecular Syndromology
Phonetica
Sexual Development

Also excluded a journal for which I couldn't find the reference format. Also doesn't
seem very "Karger":
Food Science and Technology Research
